                        This session moves slower and will provide a more gentle introduction. Girls will develop a deep
                        understanding of HTML and CSS and create their own customized webpage. Girls will also have the
                        option to try JavaScript or to learn how to add animation to their websites. August 3rd-7th.

                        session will move at a faster pace and is better suited for those more familiar with technology.
                        Prior programming experience is not required but is encouraged. August 10th-14th.
